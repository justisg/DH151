# Week 3 Thinking Cap
## UX Design Reflection
Fall quarter this year, I took a course on UX/UI Design within the Digital Humanities. Prior to that course, I had absolutely no experience in the field, but through the work, I was able to learn more. I specifically was made aware of the importance of user testing and getting feedback from many individuals to create the best possible end product. It is an interesting field, as the article states, because of the ways it intersects web building and technology and creativity and design. It is a typically unseen role, however it is imperative, especially for building a website. In the article, I was very interested in looking at the UX pyramid, which I have not seen before. It seems to be a very useful resource for prioritization and focus within this work. Especially given the importance of functionality on mobile devices, focus on how a user will interact with a product, site, or application is significant for its success. Within the video, I enjoyed hearing about how UX designers deal with problems in their work and the way their designs evolve throughout the entire process.
