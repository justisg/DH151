        <h1> About Me! </h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Justis Guardia and I am a 4th year <b>Design and Production Major</b> with a double minor in <b>Digital Humanities</b> and <b>Urban and Regional Studies.</b>
            I am graduating this spring so this course is one of my last undergraduate college courses!
        </p>
        <p> I am really excited about this class and the technical skills I will be able to gain from the coursework. GIS and mapping are extremely relevant in both the fields of Digital Humanities and Urban Planning so I know that this will be useful for my future career and graduate studies.
        </p>
        <p> Some of my hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Art </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Painting</li>
                <li> Photography</li>
                <li> Collage</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Skiing and Surfing </li>
            <li> Reading </li>
        </ul>
